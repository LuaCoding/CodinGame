# CodinGame
 All my finished and fully working CodinGame results in one place.
 
/!\ Please note that Clash of Code does not represent my actual skill. 
In this gamemode you are rushed by a time limit as well as the objective to be the first person to finish.
Therefore my code may be sloppy, have bad variable naming or an inefficient method but works.
I use the code on this repository as well as CodinGame matches to improve my skills.
